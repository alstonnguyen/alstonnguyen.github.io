Hello! My name is Alston and I'm a Software Engineer based out of Los Angeles, CA and currently working on OpenSource and professional projects while attending Georgia Tech to obtain my masters in computer science. My plan for this website is to organize and present personal and professional projects, concepts, and document educational progress in topics that interest me.
