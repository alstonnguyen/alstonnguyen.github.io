I’m Alston Nguyen, a Software Engineer based in Los Angeles, CA, currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I’m passionate about building scalable software, exploring open-source ecosystems, and developing intuitive, data-driven tools that make technology more accessible and impactful.

I’ve worked across industries—from healthcare analytics and aerospace manufacturing to modern web platforms—where I’ve built full-stack applications, optimized data pipelines, and led product initiatives that improve system efficiency and user experience. Most recently, I’ve been focused on open-source development and a stealth startup, where I’m engineering a next-generation scheduling and calendar platform using Flutter and Supabase.

This website is a space to share my projects, technical insights, and learning journey as I continue exploring areas like distributed systems, real-time data visualization, and AI-driven automation. My goal is to demonstrate not just what I build—but how I think, design, and grow as an engineer.
